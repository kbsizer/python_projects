## Web Development

There are two dominant Python frameworks for web development: **Flask** and **Django**.  Flask has the quickest ramp up, while Django offers greater flexibility and control over the end product.

Flask started in 2010 as an April Fool's joke.   As of mid 2016, Flask was the most popular Python web development framework on [GitHub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub)
